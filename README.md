}
```

##### Notes 
- If extensions used by source account are not available in target account, import MAY fail
   1) Control/Group/Page contributions on work item form are by default imported, so it will fail if the extension is not available on target account. use 'skipImportFormContributions' option to skip importing custom controls.
- If identities used in field default value or rules are not available in target account, import WILL fail
   1) For rules you may use 'continueOnRuleImportFailure' option to proceed with rest of import when such error is occurred.
   2) For identity field default value, you may use 'continueOnFieldDefaultValueFailure' option to proceed with rest of import when such error is occurred.
